Diabetic Screening Web App with Streamlit and Machine Learning

This repository contains a web application for diabetes risk and diabetic retinopathy (DR) stage prediction using clinical features and retinal images. The app utilizes machine learning models â€” a multilayer perceptron (MLP) for diabetes prediction from clinical data, and a convolutional neural network (CNN) based on EfficientNetB3 architecture for DR classification from retinal images.

Built using Python, Streamlit, TensorFlow, and popular ML libraries, this application offers an interactive, user-friendly interface for rapid screening. It allows users to upload retinal images (JPEG/PNG), enter clinical parameters, and receive instant risk assessments.

Key components include:

Streamlit-based frontend and backend integration

Pretrained model loading and inference pipelines

Clear output formatting with risk scores and stage classification

Support code and Jupyter notebooks for training and experimentation

This project demonstrates the practical application of deep learning and clinical data analysis in healthcare technology to aid early diabetes and DR diagnosis.

## ğŸ§  How It Works

- Upload clinical data and/or retinal images
- Predicts diabetes risk from clinical features (e.g., glucose, pregnancies)
- Classifies diabetic retinopathy stage from retinal images using deep learning
- Displays results and risk scores interactively
